            <h3>Photogammetry Results</h3>
            <h6>University of Oregon</h6>
            <p>The results from the photogammetry were somewhat disappointing. Because of corruption issues in the image
                files resulting from a computer crash, and issues with recovering files
                the final models were not as complete or useful as originally hoped. The main focus of my research project, therefore, changed to showing why
            the models were not complete, and future ways to fix the shortcomings apparent in my project. I found out after the study abroad that there were specific
            guidelines for how the photos should be taken for the photogammetry software, in our case <a href="http://www.agisoft.com/">Agisoft Photoscan</a>.
            In my case, almost none of the photos were taken with the proper settings, or even with the proper lens, resulting in models that could either not be stitched together
            or had distorted and missing chunks from the final product. One example would be the model of a moai attached to this post. It has incredible detail, down to
            individual rocks in the tuft, but si incomplete as a result of the extreme (300mm) zoom I was using, instead of the recommended 50mm focal length. Two examples of
            models can be downloaded in the links below, and either opened up in Photoscan, or in the open source <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">Meshlab</a>.
            In the end, the photogammetry ended up not working nearly as successfully as planned or hoped for, but did teach valuable lessons on what not to do.
            Many of the lessons I took from the attempted photogammetry on Easter Island I then used to create much better models of other sturcutres and statues, some
            of which are attached to this post. They include the 24-inch Telescope dome from the University of Oregon's Pine Mountain Observatory, a statue outside the Chicago
            Board of Trade, and a pillar from a Viking Burial ground in Denmark</p>

            <h6>Anakena, Rapa Nui</h6>
            <h6>10 July 2016</h6>
            <p>
                This night of the trip was one of the best nights of my life. The moon was not going to rise until after sunrise,
                allowing for me to go see one of the darkest nights anywhere in the world. With the closest settlement around two
                thousand miles away on mainland Chile, there was no light pollution to say of. I went with Dean Hunt and a few of
                the other students on the trip to the beach at Anakena, where there are seven standing moai statues, some with the
                topknot. The night sky was beautiul, with the entire center of the Milky Way stretching over the statues and the
                Small Magenellic Cloud (SMC) visible near the horizon. The SMC is a satallite galaxy that orbits the Milky Way and
                can only be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, making this amazing nights even more incredible. More photos of this night,
                and other astrophotography, can be found on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jacobieker">Instagram</a>.
